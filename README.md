#Element Height Equalizer

---

Version : 0.0.1

---

Will give all elements equal height. Not particularly pretty. But it works, and the code is super chill and simple.

---

Should work with all modern module loaders.

---

install through bower if you so choose : `bower install --save elementHeightEqualizer`

---

use like:

```html
<div equalizer-container>
    <div equalize></div>
    <div equalize></div>
    <div equalize></div>
    <div equalize></div>
    <div equalize></div>
    <div equalize></div>
</div>
```

All elements in the equalizer container will have the same height.

You might want to hook this into the resize event to get it to work while people are resizing.
